## PyBer_Analysis
###Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the Pyber analysis is to show more detailed metrics of ride sharing by type of city and to create a visual analysis to represent this data of weekly fares based on city types.  The data is re-organized to show how the company can improve access to ride-sharing services and determine riders affordability.

###As shown in the data frame, the rural cities had the highest average fare per driver, yet the lowest rides.  Urban areas have the highest fares and the highest # of rides, yet the lowest average fare for Riders.  This could be due to population having more access to riders due to having more drivers.  The Suburban areas were low as well and the rider fare was high.  In terms of mileage and gas, as well as, the length of ride and total fare, shows that this can have a possible impact on fares for a rider.

###In Summary, there are many factors to consider especially here in 2022.  The raise of gas prices could contribute to the total fare, if you factor in the cost of gas and mileage you could help riders determine the cost of a ride, also the number of drivers in these 3 areas differ greatly.  If you have a base cost for riders, you could increase the rides in Rural and Suburban areas.  By having a base price set by gas mileage and the distance a driver needs to go to pick up a rider should factor into the total fare.  Allowing the rider to see the cost upfront could help a rider determine to use Pyber Ride.  
If we were to gather data for the whole year and increase the fare for the Urban area, the company may have more drivers for the Rural areas which generate more money. In conclusion, Urban Cities generate more revenue per Fare, riders in Urban Cities may pay less, drivers will earn less.  Rural areas generate a higher fare; however, time and gas are a factor in this analysis.  

###In conclusion, I recommend obtaining more information for the full year, add in population and demographics of the rider.  If we were to gather data for the whole year and have a base price for all riders.  You could base the analysis on dates and time vs. Gender and Age.  Also, recommend changing the riders fare based on miles.  There is other data that can be added to estimate/calculate fares by using GPS data and using the best routes.  We could estimate/calculate the differences between other types of transportation as well (i.e. Bus, Taxiâ€™s, subway, light rail etc.) vs. cost to show the benefits of using Pyber rides (i.e. Comfort, convenience, safety etc.).  This could help determine an affordable cost for the rider.
